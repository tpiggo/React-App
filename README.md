# React-App
Two react apps: Draggable and a full web application with routing!

## Miniapp
The mini app is a full stack web application where you can talk with your friends in real time and also create hero todo lists whether you are logged in or out.
When logging in, a user space becomes available where the users can instant message each other. Web sockets are used!

## Draggable
Small React Application where Draggable Components are used in order to create sticky notes. The notes are randomly generated around the DOM and the user can interact
with them by dragging them to the desired location on the screen.
